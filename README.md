LabScripts
==========

A compilation of useful scripts commonly used in canlab written in Matlab, Python, and Bash.

When adding scripts make sure that the documentation describes how to use the script and that it is reasonably well commented.

The wiki page associated with this repository can be a useful place to post tips and questions.  Try to write a brief note with markdown in the Wiki describing briefly what the script does so that others can figure out what it does and where things are.
