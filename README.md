LabScripts
==========

A compilation of useful scripts for fMRI analysis commonly used in canlab written in Matlab, Python, and Bash. These are mainly for use in the CANlab and are customized to our computing environment.

When adding scripts make sure that the documentation describes how to use the script and that it is reasonably well commented.

The <a href="https://github.com/canlab/CanlabScripts/wiki">wiki page</a> associated with this repository can be a useful place to post tips and questions.  Try to write a brief note with markdown in the Wiki describing briefly what the script does so that others can figure out what it does and where things are.

Post questions, bugs, and problems to the <a href = "https://github.com/canlab/CanlabScripts/issues">issues</a> tab.
