% this function takes a confounds file generated by fmriprep, selects some 
% desired regressors, and computes and adds some other desired regressors.
% It returns a matrix of all possible nuisance regressors, as well as a 
% matrix of a reasonable subset of regressors decided up on in lab mtg -- see below.
%
% This function also saves the output back to the fmriprep confounds file,
% so they can stay with the dataset. If the regressors it is looking for
% are already in the fmriprep confounds file, this script assumes this function was already
% run and so it does not regenerate them, and just returns what was in the
% file.
%
% in a Jan 2019 Wager lab mtg, we decided that its sensible to include the
% following in a 1st level model for task data: 24 motion regressors, CSF
% (esp. a degraded/conservative CSF mask), canlab spike detection on the
% raw data, spikes for initial volumes (5 sec), spikes as determined by DVARS / RMSQ (Zscore > 2.5), framewise displacement.  We decided _not_ to
% include WM signal, as this often can contain BOLD signal of neuronal
% origin.  -- Yoni Ashar
% Adding inputs and code for extending the number of images affected by the
% scn_spike_detection script. Based on Power (2019), we're assuming that
% TR's immediately following a transient signal spike will be affected and
% should therefore be filtered in a similar manner to the spike itself.
